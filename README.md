# Cinema Project

## Technologies Used

The following technologies have been utilized in the development of this project:

- **Java EE**: The project is built using the Java Enterprise Edition, which provides a robust framework for developing enterprise applications.
- **Servlets**: Servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and responses, allowing for the creation of dynamic web pages.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: JSP is a technology that allows for the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding Java code within HTML.
- **JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)**: JSTL provides a set of tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify common tasks.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: JDBC is used to interact with the database, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data.
- **MySQL**: The project uses MySQL as the database management system to store and manage cinema-related data.

## Design Patterns Used

To ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase, the following design patterns have been incorporated into the project:

- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: The DAO pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic, providing a flexible and scalable approach to database operations.
- **Command**: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, queues, or log requests, and supports undoable operations.
- **Factory**: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It provides a central place to create objects, making the code more flexible and maintainable.
